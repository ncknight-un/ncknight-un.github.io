## Overview:

During my Master’s in Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University, I took a Biosensors course where I designed a project meeting specific guidelines: it had to use a microcontroller, implement a biosensing application, and include processing or control of the biosignal data. I developed a “digital” fishtank in which the fish’s movement is driven by motor activation, triggered by isolating the QRS peaks of a heartbeat signal.

**School:** Purdue University - Indianapolis  
**Location:** Indianapolis, IN   
**Duration:** March 2023 - May 2023

## Key Takeaway:

This experience allowed me to develop a strong understanding of how automation continues to advance within the manufacturing industry. I thoroughly enjoyed contributing to multiple projects at GM Diecron, where our goal was to develop layouts and proposals for manufacturing within the aerospace industry. I was brought on as a contract intern on short notice to assist with designing factory floor plans and machine hardware that supported the use of collaborative robots (cobots) to automate manufacturing processes and reduce reliance on full-time labor on the plant floor.

This role also provided me with valuable hands-on experience in an industrial environment that I had not yet encountered through my academic coursework. Since completing this internship, I have received certifications in milling and lathe operation, which I hope to apply in future robotics and automation projects.
