During my Master’s in Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University, I took a Biosensors course where I designed a project meeting specific guidelines: it had to use a microcontroller, implement a biosensing application, and include processing or control of the biosignal data. I developed a “digital” fishtank in which the fish’s movement is driven by motor activation, triggered by isolating the QRS peaks of a heartbeat signal.
